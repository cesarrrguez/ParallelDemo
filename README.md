Application to see parallel for loops examples.
All samples ask in the user input for the number of threads and iterations and they count the running time.
Each iteration throws a random time sleeping process.

## Examples

### Sequential loop

A sequential for loop using a single thread.

### Parallel loop

A parallel for loop using multiple threads.

### Break parallel loop

A parallel for loop showing how to break out of the for loop at a concrete iteration specified by the user.

### Cancel parallel loop

A parallel for loop showing how to cancel the for loop, simulating a cancelation on a concrete iteration specified by the user.

### Result parallel loop

A parallel for loop showing how to store a result an use it for all iterations.

### Manual cancel parallel loop

A parallel for loop showing how to cancel the for loop by pressing a concrete key at console application.
